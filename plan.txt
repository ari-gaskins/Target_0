What I need:
- Classes
    - Players

Need a way to create a hand and assign to a Player

Need to loop through players for turns, end loop when winner is announced

Gameplay:
1) Acquire number of players
2) creates player objects based off of number of players
3) deals hands to each player, only shows during their turn
4) turns:
    1) player calculates the value of their hand, cpu checks for correctness
    2) if correct and equal to zero, player wins
    3) if correct and not equal to zero, player discards a number from their hand and draws a new one
    4) if incorrect, player calculates again
5) if player wins, game ends, asks if you want to play again, return to step 1
